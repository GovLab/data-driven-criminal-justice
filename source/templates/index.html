        <p class='b-description'>The GovLab is leading a project, funded by the John and Laura Arnold Foundation, and in close collaboration with the Office of the U.S. Chief Data Scientist at the White House, to analyze and document how data flows through the criminal justice system. The aim is to identify policy, legal, and cultural barriers to effective data sharing among and use by agencies and between agencies and researchers.</p>
        <p class='b-description'>As part of this work, the GovLab together with partners like the Justice Management Institute, are conducting a series of ongoing surveys: 1) Aimed at criminal justice practitioners working in administrative agencies and designed to assess how practitioners use data today to uncover new opportunities for using data tomorrow; 2) Designed to assess public officialsâ€™ capacity for using data in order to determine the need for greater skill-building and training; 3) Targeted at empirical criminal justice researchers to learn whether and if they have access to the data needed to develop reforms and innovations.</p>
